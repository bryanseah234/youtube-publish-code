# youtube-publish-drafts
Publish all your draft videos without clicking by using javascript
![quick demo](youtube-publisher-demo.gif)

## how it would be used
if you were to do that, (which I'm pretty sure is against YouTube's terms of use, so don't do that), you'd:
1. go to YouTube Studio's "Content"  page
2. go to developer console after 'crtl + shift+ i'
3. paste the entire content of youtube-publish-drafts.js file
4. press 'enter'

It should work as of 04.01.2021.
